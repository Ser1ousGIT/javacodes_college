I have already mentioned that I have prior knowledge of Java but since it is a part of curriculum in my college I'll be updating with every piece of code I'll be writing in my college. 

Primarily, my goal is to document the codes. 
Other than that I'd try to make projects in Java as well that would be more personal using the knowledge I learn.
I'll also try to learn advanced concepts that might not be taught in my college. 

Hope to keep you updated.
